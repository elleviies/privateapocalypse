        <h2>Blood Moon Prophecy</h2>
        <div id="scroll" style="overflow:scroll">
            <p>The blood moon prophecies are a series of prophecies in the Bible preached by Christian preachers , which state that a tetrad (a series of four consecutive lunar eclipses—coinciding on Jewish holidays—with six full moons in between, and no intervening partial lunar eclipses) which began with the April 2014 lunar eclipse is the beginning of the end times as described in the Bible. The claim of a blood moon being a sign of the beginning of the end times originates in the Book of Joel, where it is written "the sun will turn into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord comes."

        <h2>Weather-Control Mishap</h2>
        <div id="scroll" style="overflow:scroll">
            <p>Efforts to control the weather have a poor track record. Still, some researchers are talking seriously about global climate modification as a way to counteract climate change. These "geoengineering" schemes include pumping light-reflecting sulfur compounds into the stratosphere and placing giant sunshades in space. What could go wrong seems more obvious than what could go right. This approach could also lead to another doomsday weapon: Shoot an enormous cloud of chemicals into a stable spot between Earth and the sun and you could dim the whole world, possibly triggering an ice age.
