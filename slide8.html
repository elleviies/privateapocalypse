        <h2>Blood Moon Prophecy</h2>
        <div id="scroll" style="overflow:scroll">
            <p>The blood moon prophecies are a series of prophecies in the Bible preached by Christian preachers , which state that a tetrad (a series of four consecutive lunar eclipses—coinciding on Jewish holidays—with six full moons in between, and no intervening partial lunar eclipses) which began with the April 2014 lunar eclipse is the beginning of the end times as described in the Bible. The claim of a blood moon being a sign of the beginning of the end times originates in the Book of Joel, where it is written "the sun will turn into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord comes."

        <h2>Heat Death</h2>
        <div id="scroll" style="overflow:scroll">
            <p>Observations suggest that the expansion of the universe will continue forever. A popular theory is that the universe will cool as it expands, eventually becoming too cold to sustain life. For this reason, this future scenario once popularly called "Heat Death" is now known as the Big Chill or Big Freeze.
