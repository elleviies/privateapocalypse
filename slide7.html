        <h2>Zombie Apocalypse</h2>
        <div id="scroll" style="overflow:scroll">
            <p>A Zombie apocalypse is a hypothetical scenario in which a zombie outbreak becomes an exponentially growing crisis: the spreading "zombie plague" swamps law enforcement organizations, the military and health care services, leading to the panicked collapse of civil society until only isolated pockets of survivors remain. Basic services such as piped water supplies and electrical power shut down, mainstream mass media cease broadcasting, and the national government of affected countries collapses or goes into hiding.

        <h2>Genetically Modified Superhumans</h2>
        <div id="scroll" style="overflow:scroll">
            <p>The debate over human germ-line engineering—reworking genes in the sperm and egg to create inheritable new traits—sputtered out early in the last decade after gene therapy had a series of notable failures. The revival of that research suggests it is time to resume the conversation. Soon it could be possible to design babies whose DNA has been rewritten to give them greater mental and physical abilities. Such “trans­humans” might eventually be a true breed apart, able to mate only with others of their kind. If future transhumans are truly superior, they might outcompete us by benign means, marking the first synthetic transition from one hominid species to the next.
