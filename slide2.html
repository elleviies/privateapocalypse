            <p>Scientists use the Large Hadron Collider near Geneva, Switzerland, to set up controlled collisions of particles at very high speeds. The experiments have caused some to believe that the energies set free by the collisions will form a black hole powerful enough to consume Earth and all life on it.

        <h2>Nibiru cataclysm</h2>
        <div id="scroll" style="overflow:scroll">
            <p>The Nibiru cataclysm is a supposed disastrous encounter between the Earth and a large planetary object (either a collision or a near-miss) that certain groups believe will take place in the 21st century. Believers in this doomsday event usually refer to this object as Nibiru or Planet X. The idea was first put forward by Nancy Lieder, a contactee with the ability to receive messages from extraterrestrials through an implant in her brain. She states that she was chosen to warn mankind that the object would sweep through the inner Solar System.
