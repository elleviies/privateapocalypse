        <h2>Impact Winter</h2>
        <div id="scroll" style="overflow:scroll">
            <p>An impact winter is a hypothesized period of prolonged cold weather due to the impact of a large asteroid or comet on the Earth's surface. If an asteroid were to strike land or a shallow body of water, it would eject an enormous amount of dust, ash, and other material into the atmosphere, blocking the radiation from the Sun. This would cause the global temperature to decrease drastically. If an asteroid or comet with the diameter of about 5 km or more were to hit in a large deep body of water or explode before hitting the surface, there would still be an enormous amount of debris ejected into the atmosphere. It has been proposed that an impact winter could lead to mass extinction, wiping out many of the world's existing species.

        <h2>Sperm Count Drop</h2>
        <div id="scroll" style="overflow:scroll">
            <p>Researchers assessing the results of nearly 200 studies say sperm counts among men from North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, seem to have halved in less than 40 years.The study also indicates the rate of decline among men living in these countries is continuing and possibly even increasing.If the trend continues humans would become extinct.
