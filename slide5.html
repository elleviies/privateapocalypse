        <h2>Nibiru Cataclysm</h2>
        <div id="scroll" style="overflow:scroll">
            <p>The Nibiru cataclysm is a supposed disastrous encounter between the Earth and a large planetary object (either a collision or a near-miss) that certain groups believe will take place in the 21st century. Believers in this doomsday event usually refer to this object as Nibiru or Planet X. The idea was first put forward by Nancy Lieder, a contactee with the ability to receive messages from extraterrestrials through an implant in her brain. She states that she was chosen to warn mankind that the object would sweep through the inner Solar System.

        <h2>Gray Goo</h2>
        <div id="scroll" style="overflow:scroll">
            <p>Gray goo is a hypothetical global catastrophic scenario involving molecular nanotechnology in which out-of-control self-replicating machines consume all biomass on Earth while building more of themselves, a scenario that has been called ecophagy ("eating the environment”). Example: Billions of nanobots are released to clean up an oil spill. However, due to a programming error, the nanobots devour all carbon based objects, instead of just the hydrocarbons of the oil. The nanobots destroy everything, all the while, replicating themselves. Within days, the planet is turned to dust.
