        <h2>Environmental Toxins </h2>
        <div id="scroll" style="overflow:scroll">
                <p> Modern history abounds with frightening examples of the dangers of industrial pollutants. But the poisoning continues. In major cities around the world, the air is thick with diesel particulates, which the National Institutes of Health now considers a carcinogen. Heavy metals from industrial smokestacks circle the globe, even settling in the pristine snows of Antarctica. Intensive use of pesticides in farming guarantees runoff into rivers and lakes. In high doses, dioxins can disrupt fetal development and impair reproductive function — and dioxins are everywhere. Your house may contain polyvinyl chloride pipes, wallpaper, and siding, which belch dioxins if they catch fire or are incinerated.There are also the unknown risks to think about. Every year NIH adds to its list of cancer-causing substances. Theo Colburn of the World Wildlife Fund argues that dioxins and other, similar chlorine-bearing compounds mimic the effects of human hormones well enough that they could seriously reduce fertility.

        <h2>CME</h2>
        <div id="scroll" style="overflow:scroll">
                <p> Solar coronal mass ejections (CME) hit Earth's magnetosphere and induce geomagnetic storms. A large solar storm would be powerful enough to knock out electrical and communications systems across Earth for days, months, or even years – nixing power grids, satellites, GPS, the internet, telephones, transportation systems, banking.
