        <h2>Environmental Toxins </h2>
        <div id="scroll" style="overflow:scroll">
                <p> Modern history abounds with frightening examples of the dangers of industrial pollutants. But the poisoning continues. In major cities around the world, the air is thick with diesel particulates, which the National Institutes of Health now considers a carcinogen. Heavy metals from industrial smokestacks circle the globe, even settling in the pristine snows of Antarctica. Intensive use of pesticides in farming guarantees runoff into rivers and lakes. In high doses, dioxins can disrupt fetal development and impair reproductive function — and dioxins are everywhere. Your house may contain polyvinyl chloride pipes, wallpaper, and siding, which belch dioxins if they catch fire or are incinerated.There are also the unknown risks to think about. Every year NIH adds to its list of cancer-causing substances. Theo Colburn of the World Wildlife Fund argues that dioxins and other, similar chlorine-bearing compounds mimic the effects of human hormones well enough that they could seriously reduce fertility.

        <h2>Mass Insanity</h2>
        <div id="scroll" style="overflow:scroll">
            <p>While physical health has improved in most parts of the world over the past century, mental health is getting worse. The World Health Organization estimates that 500 million people around the world suffer from a psychological disorder. By 2020, depression will likely be the second leading cause of death and lost productivity, right behind cardiovascular disease.Increasing human life spans may actually intensify the problem, because people have more years to experience the loneliness and infirmity of old age. Perhaps a lifetime of accumulated sensations will overload the human brain, leading to a new kind of insanity or fostering the spread of doomsday cults, determined to reclaim life's endpoint. Perhaps the current trends of depression and suicide among the elderly will continue. One possible solution — promoting a certain kind of mental well-being with psychoactive drugs such as Prozac — heads into uncharted waters. Researchers have no good data on the long-term effects of taking these medicines.
