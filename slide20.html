        <h2>Extinction of Bees</h2>
        <div id="scroll" style="overflow:scroll">
            <p>The death of the honeybee means the loss of plants that bees pollinate, all of the animals that eat those plants and so on up the food chain. Which means a world without bees could struggle to sustain the global human population of 7 billion. If bees disappeared off the face of the earth, man would only have four years left to live.

        <h2>Asteroid Impact</h2>
        <div id="scroll" style="overflow:scroll">
            <p>There is no question that a cosmic interloper will hit Earth, and we won't have to wait millions of years for it to happen. Impacts are most likely to occur over the ocean, and small ones that happen over land are most likely to affect unpopulated areas. But with big asteroids, it doesn't matter much where they land. Objects more than a half-mile wide — which strike Earth every 250,000 years or so — would touch off firestorms followed by global cooling from dust kicked up by the impact. Humans would likely survive, but civilization might not. An asteroid five miles wide would cause major extinctions, like the one that may have marked the end of the age of dinosaurs. The Kuiper belt, a zone just beyond Neptune that contains roughly 100,000 ice-balls more than 50 miles in diameter sends a steady rain of small comets earthward. If one of the big ones headed right for us, that would be it for pretty much all higher forms of life, even cockroaches.
