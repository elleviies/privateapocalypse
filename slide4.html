        <h2>Gamma-ray burst </h2>
        <div id="scroll" style="overflow:scroll">
            <p> Gamma-ray bursts, astrophysicists recently learned, originate in distant galaxies and are unfathomably powerful — as much as 10 quadrillion times as energetic as the sun. The bursts probably result from the merging of two collapsed stars. Before the cataclysmal event, such a double star might be almost completely undetectable, so we'd likely have no advance notice if one is lurking nearby. Once the burst begins, however, there would be no missing its fury. At a distance of 1,000 light-years — farther than most of the stars you can see on a clear night — it would appear about as bright as the sun. Earth's atmosphere would initially protect us from most of the burst's deadly X rays and gamma rays, but at a cost. The potent radiation would cook the atmosphere, creating nitrogen oxides that would destroy the ozone layer. Without the ozone layer, ultraviolet rays from the sun would reach the surface at nearly full force, causing skin cancer and, more seriously, killing off the tiny photosynthetic plankton in the ocean that provide oxygen to the atmosphere and bolster the bottom of the food chain.

        <h2>False vacuum</h2>
        <div id="scroll" style="overflow:scroll">
            <p>Quantum fields want to move from a high energy state to a lower energy state. When they are in the lowest energy state possible, they're stable. The fear is that one of these quantum fields is not actually stable, but rather exists in a "false vacuum." This means it still contains potential energy. If this energy was somehow triggered, it would create a rolling tide of destruction, vaporizing everything in its path, and leaving in its wake a void where physics as we know it would cease to exist and life would be impossible.
