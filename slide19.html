        <h2>Reversal of Earth's Magnetic Field 
        </h2>
        <div id="scroll" style="overflow:scroll">
            <p> Every few hundred thousand years Earth's magnetic field dwindles almost to nothing for perhaps a century, then gradually reappears with the north and south poles flipped. The last such reversal was 780,000 years ago, so we may be overdue. Worse, the strength of our magnetic field has decreased about 5 percent in the past century.The magnetic field deflects particle storms and cosmic rays from the sun, as well as even more energetic subatomic particles from deep space. Without magnetic protection, these particles would strike Earth's atmosphere, eroding the already beleaguered ozone layer.

        <h2>Sperm Count Drop</h2>
        <div id="scroll" style="overflow:scroll">
            <p>Researchers assessing the results of nearly 200 studies say sperm counts among men from North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, seem to have halved in less than 40 years.The study also indicates the rate of decline among men living in these countries is continuing and possibly even increasing.If the trend continues humans would become extinct.
