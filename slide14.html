        <h2>Weather-Control Mishaps </h2>
        <div id="scroll" style="overflow:scroll">
            <p> Efforts to control the weather have a poor track record. Still, some researchers are talking seriously about global climate modification as a way to counteract climate change. These "geoengineering" schemes include pumping light-reflecting sulfur compounds into the stratosphere and placing giant sunshades in space. What could go wrong seems more obvious than what could go right. This approach could also lead to another doomsday weapon: Shoot an enormous cloud of chemicals into a stable spot between Earth and the sun and you could dim the whole world, possibly triggering an ice age.

        <h2>Dark Matter Clump</h2>
        <div id="scroll" style="overflow:scroll">
            <p>Dark matter is the heavy but invisible (and as yet undetected) stuff believed to hold galaxies together. If a clump passed near our sun, its pull could shake loose comets from the outer solar system, sending some of them crashing into Earth. If a dark cloud headed right into (and through) Earth, that might have dire consequences too. In theory, dark matter particles could interact with each other, giving off gamma radiation. The radiation would not only cause a wave of mutations but also heat up Earth’s interior and trigger massive volcanism, leading to a double extinction.
