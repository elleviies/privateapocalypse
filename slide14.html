            <p> Observations suggest that the expansion of the universe will continue forever. A popular theory is that the universe will cool as it expands, eventually becoming too cold to sustain life. For this reason, this future scenario once popularly called "Heat Death" is now known as the Big Chill or Big Freeze.

        <h2>Dark Matter Clump</h2>
        <div id="scroll" style="overflow:scroll">
            <p>Dark matter is the heavy but invisible (and as yet undetected) stuff believed to hold galaxies together. If a clump passed near our sun, its pull could shake loose comets from the outer solar system, sending some of them crashing into Earth. If a dark cloud headed right into (and through) Earth, that might have dire consequences too. In theory, dark matter particles could interact with each other, giving off gamma radiation. The radiation would not only cause a wave of mutations but also heat up Earth’s interior and trigger massive volcanism, leading to a double extinction.
