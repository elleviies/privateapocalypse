        <h2>Genetically Modified Superhumans </h2>
        <div id="scroll" style="overflow:scroll">
                <p> The debate over human germ-line engineering—reworking genes in the sperm and egg to create inheritable new traits—sputtered out early in the last decade after gene therapy had a series of notable failures. The revival of that research suggests it is time to resume the conversation. Soon it could be possible to design babies whose DNA has been rewritten to give them greater mental and physical abilities. Such “trans­humans” might eventually be a true breed apart, able to mate only with others of their kind. If future transhumans are truly superior, they might outcompete us by benign means, marking the first synthetic transition from one hominid species to the next.

        <h2>Solar Shutdown</h2>
        <div id="scroll" style="overflow:scroll">
            <p> When the Sun was not emitting the ex­pected number of particles known as neutrinos, some solar physicists proposed that our star might go through million-year stretches of reduced activity, during which time its brightness could drop by perhaps 40 percent. Although the initial evidence for a solar shutdown has evaporated, the mechanism remains possible. Such a dip would put our planet in a deep freeze. If the sun dimmed significantly today, the oceans would gradually freeze solid, and most multicellular life on Earth—humans included—would probably go extinct.
