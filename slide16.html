        <h2>Mass Insanity</h2>
        <div id="scroll" style="overflow:scroll">
            <p>While physical health has improved in most parts of the world over the past century, mental health is getting worse. The World Health Organization estimates that 500 million people around the world suffer from a psychological disorder. By 2020, depression will likely be the second leading cause of death and lost productivity, right behind cardiovascular disease. Increasing human life spans may actually intensify the problem, because people have more years to experience the loneliness and infirmity of old age. Perhaps a lifetime of accumulated sensations will overload the human brain, fostering the spread of doomsday cults determined to reclaim life's endpoint or spreading a new kind of epidemic hysteria/mass hysteria, which is the rapid spread of illness signs and symptoms affecting members of a cohesive group, originating from a nervous system disturbance involving excitation, loss, or alteration of function, whereby physical complaints that are exhibited unconsciously have no corresponding organic cause.

        <h2>Solar Shutdown</h2>
        <div id="scroll" style="overflow:scroll">
            <p> When the Sun was not emitting the ex­pected number of particles known as neutrinos, some solar physicists proposed that our star might go through million-year stretches of reduced activity, during which time its brightness could drop by perhaps 40 percent. Although the initial evidence for a solar shutdown has evaporated, the mechanism remains possible. Such a dip would put our planet in a deep freeze. If the sun dimmed significantly today, the oceans would gradually freeze solid, and most multicellular life on Earth—humans included—would probably go extinct.
