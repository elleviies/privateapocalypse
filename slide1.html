            <p>The death of the honeybee means the loss of plants that bees pollinate, all of the animals that eat those plants and so on up the food chain. Which means a world without bees could struggle to sustain the global human population of 7 billion. If bees disappeared off the face of the earth, man would only have four years left to live.

        <h2>False vacuum</h2>
        <div id="scroll" style="overflow:scroll">
            <p>Quantum fields want to move from a high energy state to a lower energy state. When they are in the lowest energy state possible, they're stable. The fear is that one of these quantum fields is not actually stable, but rather exists in a "false vacuum." This means it still contains potential energy. If this energy was somehow triggered, it would create a rolling tide of destruction, vaporizing everything in its path, and leaving in its wake a void where physics as we know it would cease to exist and life would be impossible.
